Unautomated Setup
=================

This file lists parts of Windows setup that are not automated. Typically, this is due to technical or practical reasons.

* PowerShell execution policy [We've had various problems when running this from Chef. Not worth the trouble]
* All Boot Camp software
* All VMWare virtual machine software
* Diablo 2
* Microsoft Office
* Visual Studio
* Skitch Desktop and Skitch Touch
* RCT2 GoG; UCES
* Powertab installation and config (see todos)
* I ran `Update-Help` in PowerShell to get help documentation for PowerShell.

* LastPass (Chocolatey package seems not to work)
* GitHub for Windows (Chocolatey package is out-of-date)
