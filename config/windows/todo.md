* Emacs
* Emulators (Game Boy, N64)
* Chocolatey seems broken in many ways. Try to find fixes, or we may have to remove. We can't depend on unstable software.
* LastPass installation
* Fix Powertab installation with Chocolatey. It only seems to work with Windows Powershell (x86) [from Administrative Tools] run as Administrator. And even that only works in the x86 console itself. Argh.
* Decide on an SSH and VNC client and uninstall all others.
* ConEmu configs.
* Steam
* Consider adding Chocolatey packages:
    * Posh-VsVars
    * sysinterals
    * PowerGUI
* Pester (PowerShell testing framework) looks neat.
