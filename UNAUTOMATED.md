Unautomated Setup
=================

This file lists part of my MacBook setup that is not automated. Typically, this is due to technical or practical reasons.

* Caffeine

In the Mac App store.

* Skitch

In the Mac App store.

* Seagate Dashboard

Installed with my Seagate external hard drive. Hard to automate, since the software is on the drive itself. May not want to automate, since this seems very specific to the device itself.

* Swap Caps Lock and Control

Apparently, not really too easy to automate. I haven't looked into it too much, since it's pretty easy to do manually.

* Desktop backgrounds

This is a little overkill. It's nice to automate, but I change these from time to time manually, and that would be just one more thing to change every time.

* GVSU's VPN (Network Connect)

This comes from GVSU, and the versions need to remain consistent.

* Qt 5

This is installed using an application installer (an app bundle in the DMG which installs Qt), and is therefore hard to automate.
